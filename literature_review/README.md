Inoue S, Egi M, Kotani J, Morita K. Accuracy of blood-glucose measurements using glucose meters and arterial blood gas analyzers in critically ill adult patients: systematic review. Crit Care. 2013 Mar 18;17(2):R48. doi: 10.1186/cc12567. PMID: 23506841; PMCID: PMC3672636.

Results: We reviewed 879 articles and found 21 studies in which the accuracy of blood-glucose monitoring by arterial blood gas analyzers and/or glucometers by using central laboratory methods as references was assessed in critically ill adult patients. Of those 21 studies, 11 studies in which International Organization for Standardization criteria, error-grid method, or percentage of values within 20% of the error of a reference were used were selected for evaluation. The accuracy of blood-glucose measurements by arterial blood gas analyzers and glucose meters by using arterial blood was significantly higher than that of measurements with glucose meters by using capillary blood (odds ratios for error: 0.04, P<0.001; and 0.36, P<0.001). The accuracy of blood-glucose measurements with arterial blood gas analyzers tended to be higher than that of measurements with glucose meters by using arterial blood (P=0.20). In the hypoglycemic range (defined as <81 mg/dl), the incidence of errors using these devices was higher than that in the nonhypoglycemic range (odds ratios for error: arterial blood gas analyzers, 1.86, P=0.15; glucose meters with capillary blood, 1.84, P=0.03; glucose meters with arterial blood, 2.33, P=0.02). Unstable hemodynamics (edema and use of a vasopressor) and use of insulin were associated with increased error of blood glucose monitoring with glucose meters.

Conclusions: Our literature review showed that the accuracy of blood-glucose measurements with arterial blood gas analyzers was significantly higher than that of measurements with glucose meters by using capillary blood and tended to be higher than that of measurements with glucose meters by using arterial blood. These results should be interpreted with caution because of the large variation of accuracy among devices. Because blood-glucose monitoring was less accurate within or near the hypoglycemic range, especially in patients with unstable hemodynamics or receiving insulin infusion, we should be aware that current blood glucose-monitoring technology has not reached a high enough degree of accuracy and reliability to lead to appropriate glucose control in critically ill patients.

 If an arterial catheter is available, arterial blood is preferred to monitor blood glucose in critically ill patients. If no arterial catheter is available, it is recommended that blood samples should be taken from a venous catheter (Grade 2+, weak recommendation). 

 Capillary blood samples (needle prick) are indicated for critically ill patients with a relatively mild condition, no edema of the extremities, and no invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, but are not indicated for critically ill patients.

Comparing the accuracy of point-of-care with laboratory (capillary, venous, and arterial) blood glucose levels in critically ill patients with and without shock. BMC Res Notes. 2022 Dec 17;15(1):372. doi: 10.1186/s13104-022-06256-0. PMID: 36528779; PMCID: PMC9758800. [Full Text, OA](https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06256-0)

Summary: 268 patients with prospectively collected simultaneous venous, arterial, and capillary samples. 

Conclusions: "We were able to obtain data on 268 patients for this investigation. POCT and lab findings of venous and central blood did not differ significantly (P = 0.389 and 0.208), while POCT indicated somewhat higher results with venous glucose concentrations of 10.18 and 10.05 (POCT and lab tests respectively) and 9.18 and 9.54 (POCT and lab tests respectively). In addition, the mean differences between POC and laboratory analyses of venous, arterial, and central glucose were 0.13, − 1.75, and − 0.36 mmol/L for venous, arterial, and central glucose, respectively. Except for arterial blood glucose, we did not observe a significant difference between POCT and routine laboratory analysis of glucose concentrations in critically ill patients. Compared to laboratory blood analysis, the use of POCT is marginally accurate, with no difference between shocked and non-shocked patients."

Clin Chim Acta. 2008 Oct;396(1-2):10-3. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2008.06.010. Epub 2008 Jun 18. PMID: 18606159.

Summary: 84 patients with 114 paired samples ona tight glycemic protocol

Results: The mean glucose levels of all arterial/venous/fingerstick samples using the glucose meter demonstrated a positive bias of 0.7-0.9 mmol/l (12.6-16.2 mg/dl) (p<0.001) relative to central laboratory venous plasma. There was also a smaller positive (0.1-0.3 mmol/l or 1.8-5.4 mg/dl, p<0.05) bias for arterial/venous blood gas samples and laboratory arterial serum/plasma glucose samples. Using Parkes error grid analysis we were able to show that the bias for arterial or venous POC glucose results would have not impacted clinical care. This was not the case, however, for fingerstick sampling where a high bias could have significantly impacted clinical care. Additionally, in 3 fingerstick samples a severe underestimation (<46% of the central laboratory plasma result) was found.

Conclusion: Glucose meters using arterial/venous whole blood may be utilized in the MICU; however, due to the increased variability of results we do not recommend the routine use of capillary blood sampling for monitoring glucose levels in the MICU setting.

### Shearer A 2009
Shearer A, Boehmer M, Closs M, Dela Rosa R, Hamilton J, Horton K, McGrath R, Schulman C. Comparison of glucose point-of-care values with laboratory values in critically ill patients. Am J Crit Care. 2009 May;18(3):224-30. doi: 10.4037/ajcc2009448. PMID: 19411582.

Methods: A method-comparison design was used. Point-of-care values for fingerstick and catheter blood samples were compared with laboratory values for blood from catheters in a convenience sample of 63 critically ill patients. Device bias and precision were calculated and graphed according to the Bland-Altman method, and a t test was used to determine differences in glucose values for the 2 methods.

Results: Laboratory glucose values for blood from a catheter sample differed significantly from point-of-care values for blood from a fingerstick (t(1,61) = 5.01; P < .001) and from a catheter (t(1,61) = 3.91; P < .001). Bias and precision for the point-of-care device was large (fingerstick, 8.7 and 13.7; catheter, 7.0 and 14.0); 20% of the values differed from the laboratory glucose values by more than 20 mg/dL. Point-of-care glucose values for fingerstick and catheter samples did not differ (P = .41).

Conclusions: Glucose values obtained with a point-of-care device differ significantly from those obtained by laboratory analysis. The magnitude of these differences calls into question the widespread practice of using point-of-care glucose testing to guide insulin titration for tight glucose control. Errors in dosing could easily be made because of the large bias and precision associated with a point-of-care device.

Critchell CD, Savarese V, Callahan A, Aboud C, Jabbour S, Marik P. Accuracy of bedside capillary blood glucose measurements in critically ill patients. Intensive Care Med. 2007 Dec;33(12):2079-84. doi: 10.1007/s00134-007-0835-4. Epub 2007 Sep 1. PMID: 17763842.

Measurements: This prospective observational study compared fingerstick measurements to simultaneously sampled laboratory glucose once a day in patients in our medical ICU (twice daily if on an insulin infusion). Data recorded included patient demographics, admission diagnoses, APACHE II score, BMI, daily hematocrit, arterial blood gasses, chemistry results, concomitant medications (including vasopressors and corticosteroids), and upper extremity edema. Accuracy was defined as the percentage of paired values not in accord (>15 mg dl(-1)/ 0.83 mmol(-1)l(-1) difference for laboratory values <75 mg dl(-1)/4.12 mmol(-1)l(-1) and >20% difference for laboratory values >or=75 mg/dl). Outliers (blood glucose difference >100 mg dl(-1)/5.56 mmol(-1) l(-1)) were excluded from the correlation and distribution analyses.

Results: Mean fingerstick glucose was 129+/-45 mg/dl (7.2+/-2.5 mmol/l) and mean laboratory glucose 123+/-44 mg/dl (6.8+/-2.4 mmol/l). The correlation coefficient between the two values was 0.9110 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute threshold 0.9751). The mean difference (bias) between the two methods was 8.6+/-18.6 mg/dl (0.48+/-1.0 mmol/l) and limits of agreement +45.8 and -28.6 mg/dl (+2.5 and -1.6 mmol/l). Fifty-three (19%) paired measurements in 22 patients were not in accord (CLSI threshold <or=5%). In 44 (83%) of these paired measurements fingerstick glucose was greater than laboratory glucose.

Conclusions: The findings suggest that capillary blood glucose as measured by fingerstick is inaccurate in critically ill ICU patients and does not meet the CLSI standard. It is unclear whether the sampling method, device used, or both contributed to this inaccuracy. The wide limits of agreement suggest that fingerstick measurements should be used with great caution in protocols of tight glycemic control.
